**How to Release a Payment**

1. **Switch to the Moongig client.**
2. Ensure your account has **payout admin access** (contact the Tech Team if access is needed).
3. Navigate to the **Payout Page** and open the new **‚ÄúOthers‚Äù** tab.
4. Click **New Payout** and fill in the required fields:
   * **Name of the user**
   * **Transaction type (See table below for the list)**
   * **Covered start and end date**
   * **Amount (Gross amount)**
   *   **Applicable taxes** ‚Äì None, 5%, or 10%

       > üí° The payout amount is **gross amount minus applicable taxes**\
       > e.g., ‚Ç±500 gross with 5% tax = ‚Ç±475 payout.
5. The **user‚Äôs payout details** will automatically appear once a user is selected.
6. Review all details carefully before confirming.
7. Once confirmed, the **payout will be released instantly**, provided there are no issues with the receiving bank or payout details.

## Quick sign up for Ambassadors
