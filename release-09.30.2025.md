## Minor UI Changes / Enhancements

### Merged Job/Shift Buttons

* We have merged all the job/shift related action buttons (**unpublish**, **edit**, **note**, **share**) and left "**close job**" as is. This is to lessen the clutter in the navigation and keep all other action buttons in a dropdown so it is all found in one place
