# Release 10.10.2025

## Opt In to Notifications

* **New users** are now prompted to **opt into shift and job notifications** right after creating their account.&#x20;
* **Existing users** will see the same modal the next time they open the app. The modal toggles for both notification types should be **ON by default**.
* Users can later manage these notification preferences under **Account → Notifications.**
* If **Shift Notifications are turned off**, the user will not receive notifications about new or recommended shifts. However, if they apply to a shift, they will still receive notifications related to that specific shift, such as reminders, payout updates, or confirmation status.
* Similarly, if **Job Notifications are turned off,** the user will not get job recommendation alerts, but they will still receive notifications related to jobs they have applied for, including status updates and interview reminders.
